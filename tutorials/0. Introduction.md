### Introduction

<p>Redis is an advanced key-value cache and store. It is often referred to as a data structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps and hyperloglogs.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/redis/helm">Bitnami Redis chart</a> bootstraps a Redis deployment on a Kubernetes cluster using the Helm package manager.</p>
<p>Bitnami charts can be used with Kubeapps for deployment and management of Helm Charts in clusters. This chart has been tested to work with NGINX Ingress, cert-manager, fluentd and Prometheus on top of the BKPR.</p>

<h3>Two different charts are available for redis</h3>
<p>
1. <a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis">Redis Helm Chart</a><br>
2. <a href="https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/master/bitnami/redis-cluster">Redis Cluster Helm Chart</a>
</p>
<p>You can choose any of the two Redis Helm charts for deploying a Redis cluster. While Redis Helm Chart will deploy a master-slave cluster using Redis Sentinel, the Redis Cluster Helm Chart will deploy a Redis Cluster topology with sharding. The main features of each chart are the following:</ps>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Redis</th>
    <th>Redis Cluster</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Supports multiple databases</td>
    <td>Supports only one database. Better if you have a big dataset</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Single write point (single master)</td>
    <td>Multiple write points (multiple masters)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/operator-playground-io/redis-chart-tile/blob/main/_images/redis-topology.png"/></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/operator-playground-io/redis-chart-tile/blob/main/_images/redis-cluster-topology.png"/></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Redis helm chart shall be explored in this tutorial</p>
